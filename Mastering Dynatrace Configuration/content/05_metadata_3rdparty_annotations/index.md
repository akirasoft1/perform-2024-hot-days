## Metadata - 3rd Party - K8s Annotations

In the previous module you learned about tagging. In this module, you will learn more about metadata and how to use 3rd party data (Annotations from Kubernetes) as metadata in Dynatrace. We will use annotations from Kubernetes pods to popluate metadata into Dynatrace.

In this module you will go through the following actions:

1. Metadata use cases and sources for Kubernetes Annotations
1. Update labels from Kubernetes
1. Verify updates to metadata in Dynatrace
