## Manual Tagging

To get starting with this tagging module you first need to find the easyTrade application in Dynatrace.

#### In Dynatrace, using the left navigation menu find Frontend under the Application & Microservices section

Add a manual tag to the easyTrade application, you can use any manual tag you want, if you want you can use your first or last name to make it simple. The actions will refer to your **tag key**, replace that with whatever you decide.

- Application & Microservices  - Frontend

 ```bash
   Action: Look at the "Frontend" page
   Action: Click on the application named "My Web Application". This is your easyTrade application
   Action: Click on "Tags and Detection Rules" at the top left area, click "+ Add tag"
   Action: Type your "tag key" into the "Key" field and leave the "Value" field blank
   Action: Click on the "Add" button to save.
   ```

Add a manual tag to one of the easyTrade hosts

- Infrastructure - Hosts

 ```bash
   Action: Look at the "Hosts" page
   Action: Click on any of the hosts listed.
   Action: Click on "Properties and Tags" at the top left area, click "+ Add tag"
   Action: Type your "tag key" into the "Key" field and leave the "Value" field blank
   Action: Click on the "Add" button to save.
   ```

- Application & Microservices  - Services

 ```bash
   Action: Look at the "Services" page
   Action: Click on any of the services listed.

   Action: Type your "tag key" into the "Key" field and leave the "Value" field blank
