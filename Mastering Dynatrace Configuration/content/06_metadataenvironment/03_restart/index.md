## View the additional metadata in Dynatrace

- After the updates are applied from the previous step, we need to check to see if we see the updated Environment metadata in Dynatrace

```bash
    Action: Find the broker service, name="broker"
    Action: Check the Environment custom metadata inside the Properties section
   ```

The contents should look similiar to the following:

![brokerdt](../../assets/images/brokerdt.png)
