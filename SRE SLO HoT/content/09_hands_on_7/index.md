## Hands on #7 - Infrastructure SLO

#### Large Insurance Company utilizes Dynatrace SLOs to monitor their Infrastructure.  
#### Objective:
#### Evaluate the utilization of memory of Easytravel Backend Containers

1. There is no template for infrastructure SLOs, so weâ€™ll need to use what we learned in previous exercises to define the metrics we want to use as part of our SLO definition.

2. Navigate to *Observe and explore* > *Data Explorer* and switch to *code*
> - add the following meteric selector:

```
(builtin:containers.memory.usagePercent:avg:splitBy())
```

> This metric visualizes the average memory usage percent of containers.

3. We need to filter this metric to the *Easytravel Backend Containers*
> - replace the metric selector with the following:

```
(builtin:containers.memory.usagePercent:splitBy("dt.entity.container_group_instance")
:filter(in("dt.entity.container_group_instance", entitySelector("type(~"CONTAINER_GROUP_INSTANCE~"),fromRelationship.isCgiOfCa(
type(~"CLOUD_APPLICATION~"),entityName.equals(~"easytravel-backend~"))")))
:avg:splitBy())
```

> Now only the Easytravel Backend container memory usage percent is shown.

4. This is good, however we need the opposite (memory usage percent remaining)
> - add the following to the front of the metric selector

```
(100) - 
```

> Now we have the correct indicator for our SLO.

5. Navigate to the Service-level Objectives page and add a new SLO. 

6. Provide a meaningful name/metric for the SLO. *{ENV}_{APP NAME}_{HoT#}_{ENTITY TYPE}_{TYPE}*

```
SLO Name : Prod - Easytravel Backend - HoT7 - Container - Saturation
SLO Metric : prod_easytravelbackend_hot7_container_saturation
```

7. Set the metricselector to:

```
(100)-(builtin:containers.memory.usagePercent:avg:splitBy())
```

8. Next, let's set the filters for the SLO.
> - Time Frame - the evaluation period of SLO. *last 30 minutes* </br>
> - Entity Selector - the entities from where SLI is calculated. *workload name*</br>

```
timeFrame : -30m
entitySelector : type(CONTAINER_GROUP_INSTANCE),fromRelationships.isCgiOfCa(type(CLOUD_APPLICATION),entityName.equals(easytravel-backend))
```

9. Next, let's set our SLO target.

```
Target - 20.00
Warning - 25.00
```

10. Finally, preview the SLO and hit 'Create'

11. Navigate to *Dashboards* and identify the following dashboard : *Perform 2023 HoT*

12. Edit the SLO tile of the current Hands-On, and select the SLO we just created: *Prod - Easytravel Backend - HoT7 - Container - Saturation*
