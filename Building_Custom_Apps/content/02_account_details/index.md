## Part 2 - Account Details

In this section we'll build a detailed view of an account which will chart the account's trades and volume over time. We'll also enable EasyTrade admins to analyze account data in other apps.

By the end, you will learn how to:
- Render additional details in a data table through expandable rows
- Use the TimeseriesChart component of Strato
- Interact with other apps through intents
