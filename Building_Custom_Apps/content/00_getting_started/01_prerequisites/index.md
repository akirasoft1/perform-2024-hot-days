## Prerequisites

Before you can begin the coding exercises there are a couple of items needed for this session.

### 1. Visual Studio Code

For this session, our editor of choice is VS Code, which can be downloaded from the [official website](https://code.visualstudio.com/Download).

### 2. The Remote SSH extension

To connect to your VM, we recommend VS Code's [Remote SSH extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-ssh).

You can install it directly from the editor by going to the Extensions menu, searching for "Remote SSH" and clicking the install button.
