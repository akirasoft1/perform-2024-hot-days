## Part 1 - Accounts Overview

In this section we will build a very simple accounts overview table that shows all the registered user accounts, along with their balance in both USD and EUR. This will be the main landing page for EasyTrade admins.

By the end, you will learn how to:
- Execute a DQL query and visualize Grail data
- Use the DataTable component of Strato
- Fetch external data using a serverless function
- Handle data loading using indicators
