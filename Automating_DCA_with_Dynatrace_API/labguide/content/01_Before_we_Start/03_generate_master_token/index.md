## Generate Master Token

Keep your previously generated token handy for this step!

1. Navigate to the project folder from our preparation stage and open the generateToken.js file.

2. Copy and paste your management token into the token declaration, and tenant URL into the tenant declaration

3. Open a terminal at the root of the project directory and run the following command:

```bash
   npm run token
```
4. Verify in the terminal you've been provided a new token and that the .env file has been enriched with your connection information.
