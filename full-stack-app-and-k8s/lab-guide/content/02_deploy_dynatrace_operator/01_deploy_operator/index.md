2. On the **Monitor Kubernetes / OpenShift** page, follow the on-screen deployment instructions:
    - **Name**: This name is used by various Dynatrace settings including: Kubernetes cluster name, Network Zone, ActiveGate Group, and Host Group.
    - **Dynatrace Operator token & Data Ingest token**: To create these tokens automatically, select **Create tokens**.
    - Enable **Skip SSL Certificate Check**.
    - Click on **Download dynakube.yaml** to download dynakube.yaml locally.
    - Copy the contents within dynakube.yaml via a local file editor.
    - **Create** a new file in the terminal with `vim dynakube.yaml`
    - **Paste the content** into the created dynakube.yaml
    - Exit the file dynakube.yaml by pressing `Crtl` + `x` together and followed by `Y` to save the file and `Enter`
    - Lastly, execute the commands within the installation screen

**Note**: Be sure to execute the commands in the same directory where you downloaded the YAML, or adapt the commands to link to the location of the YAML.
