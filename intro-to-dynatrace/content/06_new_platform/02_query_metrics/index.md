## Query Metrics

1. Continue your Notebook and use markdown to create a "Query Metrics" section
2. Write the DQL queries to grab these host metrics
    * Graph the average memory usage over the last 2 hours
    * Graph the max cpu usage for each host over the last 2 hours in 30 minute intervals

*Hint: use the timeseries command*
*Hint: use the metrics on Grail [documentation](https://docs.dynatrace.com/docs/shortlink/built-in-metrics-on-grail) to find the metric keys*
