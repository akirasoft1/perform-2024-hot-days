## Hosts

1. Navigate to the Hosts page in the left-hand menu or click on your Host directly from the SmartScape.
2. Click on Properties and tags to review the properties of your Host.
3. Familiarize yourself with the types of data the Host layer will give you. **What is the current CPU usage on the Host? Are any disks low on space?**
