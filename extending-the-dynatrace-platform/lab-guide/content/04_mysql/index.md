## MySQL Extension

In this exercise, we will create a `SQL Extension` using the `Extensions 2.0 framework` from scratch.

At the end of this lab, we will have a fully fledged MySQL extension with:

* Customized entities (topology)
* Entities screens (list and detail)
* A dashboard to help users find our metrics and entities
* Included alerts
* Metrics metadata


Users can easily import and activate this extension to their Dynatrace environment.
