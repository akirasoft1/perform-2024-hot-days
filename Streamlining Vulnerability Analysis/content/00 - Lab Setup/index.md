&#9746; add attack feature flag

## Lab Setup
Before we get started with the exercises let's start with a few setup steps.

1. Verify access
2. Configure Security Monitoring Rule
3. Enable Runtime Vulnerability Analytics
4.  Enable OneAgent features
5.  Deploy Unguard App

### Verify access to environment
In Dynatrace University you will find the information on how to access the Environment required for the lab. Please make sure you can:
- Access the Dynatrace Environment using a web browser
- Connect to the bastion host using SSH

### Verify access to Dashboard
To access your dashboard, you need it's URL. In order to get it, on your University event, open the `Environments` tab and click on `Open terminal`. This will open a terminal in your VM. 
This will give you the links to the resources used during this HOT session, as seen in the screenshot below.

Comment: 3rd party will already be enabled. Still keeping this section as it is for now


### Enable runtime vulnerability detection and code-level vulnerability detection

To enable Application Security,  go to *Application Security > Security Overview* and select *Configure*.

![vulnerabilities](../../assets/images/1-2-vulnerabilities.png)

> Alternatively can also directly go to Settings > Application Security > Vulnerability Analytics > General settings.

On the Vulnerability Analytics page that opens, select *Enable Runtime Vulnerability Analytics*.

Do the same for code-level vulnerabilities by opening the *Code-Leve Vulnerability Analytics* tab.

> You also have the option to restrict it to certain technologies. 


## Enable Runtime Application Protection

To enable Runtime Application Protection,  go to Settings > Application Security > Application Protection > General settings.

On the Application Protection page that opens, select *Enable Runtime Application Protection*.  Set the *Attack Control* to **Monitor; incoming attacks detected only**

> Setting the attack protection means that exploits will be detected and reported but not blocked. 


### Enable OneAgent Features
After enabling runtime vulnerability detection, you need to enable OneAgent Java vulnerable function reporting. This is specifically just for vulnerable functions. The reporting of vulnerable components in general is generally available and running out of the box now.
- Under Settings > Preferences > OneAgent features
- Filter by *vulnerable* and enable the following features
- Java Vulnerable Function Reporting
- Filter by *code-level* and enable the following features (as per the screenshots):
- Java code-level attack evaluation (include the instrumentation enabled toggle)
- Java code-level vulnerability evaluation
